    “Wednesday’s Child is Full of Woe”
    Wednesday is expelled from her high school for attempting to murder her brother Pugsley’s bullies by throwing live piranhas into their pool.
    She is sent to Nevermore Academy, a place for outcasts, where the Principal accepts her late entry due to her good grades and family history.
    Roommate Enid introduces Wednesday to the various cliques at the school.
    Gomez tasks Thing (the sentient hand) with spying on Wednesday, but she discovers the handy sidekick.
    Sheriff Galpin investigates a serial killer or monster targeting hikers in the area.
    Wednesday befriends townie Tyler (the Sheriff’s son) and has a psychic vision about Rowan being in danger. However, Rowan tries to kill her, and the monster ultimately kills him.
