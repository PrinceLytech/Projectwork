    The Avengers began as a group of extraordinary individuals assembled to defeat Loki and his Chitauri army during the Battle of New York City. Led by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, they successfully thwarted the invasion.
    The original team consisted of Iron Man (Tony Stark), Captain America (Steve Rogers), Thor, Hulk (Bruce Banner), Black Widow (Natasha Romanoff), and Hawkeye (Clint Barton).
    Their base of operations shifted from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan to the Avengers Compound in Upstate New York
