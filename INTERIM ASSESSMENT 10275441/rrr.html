<p><h3>
    The story unfolds as Bheem, the avenging “shepherd” of the Adivasian Gond tribe, visits Delhi to rescue a kidnapped child from the evil British Governor Scott and his wife Cathy. 
    Meanwhile, Raju, a Colonial police officer, unwittingly befriends Bheem, leading to a powerful bond between the two freedom fighters. 
    The film combines maximalist action choreography, stunning visuals, and a rallying cry for reunification and resistance against colonial rule.
