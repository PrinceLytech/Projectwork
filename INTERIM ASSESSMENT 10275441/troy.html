    The Trojan War:
The Trojan War is best known from Homer’s epic poems, the “Iliad” and the “Odyssey.”
According to classical sources, the war began after the abduction (or elopement) of Queen Helen of Sparta by Prince Paris of Troy.
Helen’s husband, Menelaus, convinced his brother Agamemnon (king of Mycenae), to lead a Greek expedition to retrieve her.
Greek heroes like Achilles, Odysseus, Nestor, and Ajax joined Agamemnon, along with a fleet of over a thousand ships from various Greek regions.
They crossed the Aegean Sea to lay siege to Troy and demand Helen’s return from King Priam of Troy.
